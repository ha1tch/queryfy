# JSON Intuition System - Detailed Generation Plan

## Executive Summary

This generation plan outlines the development of a statistical pre-flight analysis system for JSON validation in Queryfy. The system uses information-theoretical approaches to detect malformed JSON before parsing, significantly reducing computational waste on corrupted data while maintaining full validation accuracy for well-formed inputs.

## 1. Core Concept Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement
- JSON parsing and validation consume significant resources on malformed data
- Current approaches waste CPU cycles discovering corruption late in the process
- No early warning system exists to route data efficiently based on quality

### 1.2 Solution Approach
- Statistical "intuition" layer that performs rapid pre-flight analysis
- Multi-dimensional scoring system to assess JSON health
- Adaptive processing pipeline based on confidence levels
- Targeted validation focusing on suspicious regions only

### 1.3 Key Innovation
- **Not a validator** - an intuition system that makes probabilistic assessments
- Progressive analysis with computational cost proportional to data quality
- "Smellmap" visualization for pinpointing problem areas

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Statistical Analysis Components

#### 2.1.1 Shannon Entropy Analysis
- **Purpose**: Detect information density anomalies
- **Method**: Sliding window entropy calculation
- **Indicators**: 
  - Very low entropy → Repetitive corruption (e.g., `{{{{{{`)
  - Very high entropy → Binary data or random corruption
  - Expected patterns → Valid JSON structure

#### 2.1.2 Symbol Distribution Analysis
- **Purpose**: Verify structural integrity
- **Metrics**:
  - Brace/bracket balance
  - Quote parity
  - Colon-to-comma ratios
  - Whitespace patterns
- **Fast rejection**: Imbalanced symbols indicate corruption

#### 2.1.3 N-gram Probability Models
- **Purpose**: Detect unnatural byte sequences
- **Implementation**: 
  - Trigram frequency analysis
  - Log probability scoring
  - Comparison against learned JSON patterns
- **Training data**: 4GB+ of real JSON from OpenLibrary dumps

#### 2.1.4 Kolmogorov Complexity Approximation
- **Purpose**: Assess structural regularity
- **Method**: Compression ratio analysis
- **Principle**: Valid JSON compresses predictably

#### 2.1.5 Markov Chain Transitions
- **Purpose**: Model valid state transitions
- **States**: In-string, in-number, in-object, etc.
- **Detection**: Impossible transitions indicate corruption

### 2.2 Advanced Localization Techniques

#### 2.2.1 Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- Track JSON parser states
- Identify exact locations of impossible transitions
- Provide context-aware error messages

#### 2.2.2 Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Detect regions statistically different from neighbors
- Identify corruption boundaries precisely
- Enable targeted validation

#### 2.2.3 Change Point Detection
- Find where statistical properties suddenly shift
- Locate truncation points
- Identify format transitions

#### 2.2.4 Mutual Information Analysis
- Measure information correlation between regions
- Detect structural breaks
- Find inconsistent patterns

### 2.3 Multi-Dimensional Scoring System

```
Dimensions:
1. Structural Integrity (0.0-1.0)
2. Entropy Consistency (0.0-1.0)
3. Symbol Distribution (0.0-1.0)
4. Local Coherence (0.0-1.0)
5. Size/Complexity Ratio (0.0-1.0)
6. Whitespace Pattern (0.0-1.0)
7. String Integrity (0.0-1.0)
8. Numeric Validity (0.0-1.0)

Weighted combination → Overall Confidence Score
```

## 3. Adaptive Processing Pipeline

### 3.1 Progressive Analysis Stages

#### Stage 1: Quick Sniff Test (~1ms)
- First/last byte validation
- Rough balance check
- Entropy spot checks
- **Decision**: Fresh/Mild/Fishy/Rotten

#### Stage 2: Deep Analysis (10ms, conditional)
- Only if Stage 1 detects problems
- Comprehensive statistical analysis
- Multi-dimensional scoring
- **Decision**: Processing strategy

#### Stage 3: Localization (10-50ms, conditional)
- Only for high-confidence corruption
- Pinpoint problem regions
- Generate "smellmap"
- **Output**: Targeted validation zones

### 3.2 Processing Strategies

1. **Trust and Proceed**: Fast path for clean data
2. **Proceed with Care**: Standard validation with monitoring
3. **Inspect Carefully**: Deep validation with focus areas
4. **Likely Corrupted**: Reject with detailed explanation

### 3.3 Smellmap Generation

```
Input: Raw JSON bytes
Output: Heat map of corruption probability

Process:
1. Coarse-grained scan (1KB chunks)
2. Fine-grained refinement (64B chunks) for suspicious areas
3. Region classification by smell type
4. Visualization for debugging
```
